         <h2>The Testimony Of Three Witnesses</h2>
         
         <p>Be It Known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall
            come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have
            seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi,
            and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came
            from the tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been translated
            by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we
            know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the
            engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power
            of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God
            came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and
            saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of
            God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these
            things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord
            commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the
            commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are
            faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found
            spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in
            the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,
            which is one God. Amen.

         <h2>The Testimony Of Eight Witnesses</h2>
         
         <p>Be It Known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall
            come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shown unto us the
            plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of
            the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also
            saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of
            curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said
            Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the
            said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto
            the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God
            bearing witness of it.
