         <p style="text-align:center">Mormon's abridgment and the smaller plates of Nephi — Relation of the foregoing part
            of the Book of Mormon to that which follows.
            
         </p><br><hr>
         <ol type="I">
            <li style="text-align:justify">And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I have been making into
               the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all the destruction of
               my people, the Nephites.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I deliver these records
               into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire destruction
               of my people. But may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write somewhat
               concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit
               them.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made
               an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of
               whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my
               hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets,
               from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of
               Nephi.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies
               of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled;
               yea, and I also know that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us down
               to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come
               to pass — 
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them, which remainder of
               my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth
               part of the things of my people.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these prophesyings and revelations,
               and put them with the remainder of my record, for they are choice unto me; and I know
               they will be choice unto my brethren.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings
               of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the
               Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according
               to his will.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the
               knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome
               people.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I take from the plates of
               Nephi; and I make it according to the knowledge and the understanding which God has
               given me.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up these plates into the
               hands of king Benjamin, he took them and put them with the other plates, which contained
               records which had been handed down by the kings, from generation to generation until
               the days of king Benjamin.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until
               they have fallen into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved
               from this time henceforth. And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great
               things written upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged
               at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And now, concerning this king Benjamin — he had somewhat of contentions among his
               own people.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down out of the land
               of Nephi, to battle against his people. But behold, king Benjamin gathered together
               his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his
               own arm, with the sword of Laban.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And in the strength of the Lord they did contend against their enemies, until they
               had slain many thousands of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did contend
               against the Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of their inheritance.
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs, and their mouths had
               been shut, and they punished according to their crimes;
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">And after there had been false prophets, and false preachers and teachers among the
               people, and all these having been punished according to their crimes; and after there
               having been much contention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold,
               it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the holy prophets who were
               among his people — 
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign over his people in righteousness;
               and there were many holy men in the land, and they did speak the word of God with
               power and with authority; and they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness
               of the people — 
               
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify">Wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of
               his body and the faculty of his whole soul, and also the prophets, did once more establish
               peace in the land.
